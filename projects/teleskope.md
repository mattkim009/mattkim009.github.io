## What is Teleskope?
Teleskope is an app that connects students to companies for job opportunities.  We match students to companies based on the student's skills and the skills needed for the company's jobs to ensure the best fit for each other.  When finding a company they like, students can follow that company and will then recieve updates about the company's activities on the site.  We used Semantic UI and React to support the front-end, MongoDB to manage the data, and Meteor as the foundation.

## My Contributions
The bulk of my work was on the front-end where I helped create the landing page, navigation bar, student index page, student card component, profile page, and edit profile component.

</div>

Behind the scenes I made sure that the student registration and company registration properly created the user profiles and companies, the properties of the user data were properly checked before being accessed, and user profile data was properly changed after successful editing.

## Looking Forward
Despite the frustration and difficulties I immensely enjoyed spending hours on my first software development project.  There's still a lot for me to learn and improve so I plan to continue developing this project during the summer.
