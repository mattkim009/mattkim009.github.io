Aloha!  From the end of October to the middle of November I participated in the month-long Hawaii Annual Code Challenge (aka HACC) with my teammates Ty Uehara and Tyler Chong.  HACC is the biggest hackathon hosted in the state of Hawai’i and serves to connect and grow the local tech community and to spur the development of tech-based solutions for problems presented by state agencies.  These problems are called “challenges” and for this year’s HACC, six challenges were presented.  Teams can only tackle one challenge and are given around 2 weeks from the start of the hackathon to produce a solution for the first review phase.  There are two review phases, the first one is the technical review phase where the code is reviewed, and the solution’s functionality is tested.  If a team passes this review, then they can continue working on and improving their solution until the second review phase.  The second review phase is the judging day presentation where teams are given 3 minutes to present their solutions and 1 minute to answer any questions the judges have about their app.  After all the presentations the winners are decided.

Of the six challenges presented, my team decided to tackle the COVID-19 Chatbot challenge provided by NIC Hawaii.  NIC Hawaii aims to bring government services to the people so for this challenge they wanted a chatbot that can provide the latest crucial information to the citizens and visitors of Hawaii.  To create this my team utilized Google’s Dialogflow API as the foundation of the application.  


I worked with Ty Uehara to and Tyler Chong to create this app.  Ty Uehara is a fellow student who is also taking ICS 491 with me and Tyler Chong is a UH Manoa alumni who is now working in the field.  Unfortunately, Tyler couldn’t dedicate too much time to our project so he mainly just helped curate resources that the dialogflow API could pull from.
