## Relevancy of Ethics

Our work as programmers have a large impact on the world and it's contributions are only growing.  We have a responsibility to ensure that this impact is not only harmless but beneficial.  However, as flawed beings, we are easily misled and need to be reminded of what's right and wrong.  Codes of ethics like the <a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics">ACM Code of Ethics</a> and <a href="https://www.computer.org/education/code-of-ethics">Professional Conduct and the IEEE Code of Ethics</a> are important reminders of what's right and wrong and keep us on a straight path.  

The ethical principles that guide software engineers are the same as the ethical principles that guide every other professional.  The difference lies in how these principles are implemented in each one's situations.  For a medical practitioner their focus is to not harm the patient and, ideally, improve the patient's physical and mental health.  Scientists are responsible for gathering empirical data that is reliable and valid, and for developing falsifiable theories and hypotheses that increase our knowledge of the world.  Software engineers are responsible for developing software that benefits the world.  To do so we must understand the power the software we develop and the power of the products that our software supports.  


## Understanding the power and impact software has

Software directs every computer in the world.  It helps guide machines, carrying millions of people per day, tens of thousands of feet in the air.  They help keep track of economies of nearly every society.  We use it to access the internet, one of the most important inventions of the technological age.  But it's not just software we have to understand, we also have to understand the power of what our software is supporting.  Be it, a drug, a plane, a database, a social network, etc.  

<a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e">In Bill Sourour's case, he failed to understand the power of the product that his software supported.</a>  He was told to code a health quiz that is supposed to recommend a suitable treatment based on the customer's answer.  Instead, it would always recommend the site's own drug unless the person was allergic to it or was already taking it.  This lead to a girls suicide for one of the main side effects of the client's drug was severe depression and suicidal thoughts.  As admitted by Bill, he, initially, didn't think much of the quiz for he was making good money and wasn't doing anything illegal at the time.  Only after learning of the consequence of the product did he realize the gravity of what he had done.  He learned of the power his products had on people's health, albeit too late.


## With great power comes great responsibility

So, what could Bill have done?  <a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics#h-2.5-give-comprehensive-and-thorough-evaluations-of-computer-systems-and-their-impacts,-including-analysis-of-possible-risks.">ACM code 2.5 states that "a computing professional should give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks."</a>  We have to remind ourselves of the power our software can have and review its implications, both positive and negative.  We can't just chalk up suspicious things as a marketing tactic or, in general, assume anything seemingly normal or accepted to be harmless.  In Bill's case he knew that the real purpose of his software was to push the company's drug, but he didn't understand or failed to remember about all of the effects the drug can have.

Bill also failed to follow <a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics#h-3.1-ensure-that-the-public-good-is-the-central-concern-during-all-professional-computing-work.">ACM code 3.1 which states that "a computing professional should ensure that the public good is the central concern during all professional computing work."</a>  Bill was selfish for not thinking of the public, knowing that the software benefitted the company but not thinking of how it would affect the public.  He was only 21-years-old and was focused on just doing the job assigned to him.  Fortunately, he has learned his lesson of software taking over every aspect of our lives and I hope we can too to prevent this from happening again.
