## Relevancy of Ethics

Our work as programmers have a large impact on the world and it's contributions are only growing.  We have a responsibility to ensure that this impact is not only harmless but beneficial.  However, as flawed beings, we are easily misled and need to be reminded of what's right and wrong.  Codes of ethics like the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct and the IEEE Code of Ethics are important reminders of what's right and wrong and keep us focused on an ethical path.  

The ethical principles that guide software engineers are still the same as the ethical principles that guide every other professional.  The difference lies in how these principles are implemented in each one's situations.  For a medical practitioner their focus is to not harm the patient and, ideally, improve the patient's physical and mental health.  Scientists are responsible for gathering reliable, verifiable, and unbiased data that society can use to 

Software engineers are to develop software that benefits the world.

We depend on software to keep track

In the case of Bill, he was told to code a misleading health prescription guide that can affect a person's well-being to a large degree.  As admitted by Bill, he ignored…

So what could Bill have done?  Bill realized what he had done after learning of the consequence of the product he had helped create.  In other words, he learned of the power his products had on people's health.  
ACM code 2.5 states that "a computing professional should give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks."
We have to remind ourselves of the power our products can have and the consequences, both positive and negative, it can produce.  In Bill's case he knew that the real purpose of his software was to push the company's drug but he didn't understand or forgot about the effects the drug can have.  It's not just software we have to focus on, we have to understand the power of what our software is supporting.  Be it, a drug, a plane, a database, a social network, etc.

Software helps guide machines carrying millions of people per day tens of thousands of feet in the air.  






Ethics, according to the oxford dictionary, are the "moral principles that govern a person's behavior or the conducting of an activity."  To behave in an "ethical manner" is to make decisions, produce products, and interact socially in a way that benefits the public good.  

Have a mindset to review and seriously consider the implications our work has on others and not just ourselves.  We can't just "chalk" it up to a marketing tactic or, in general, assume anything seemingly normal or accepted to be harmless.  Slavery was a lawful practice in the United States less than 200 years ago.  War
