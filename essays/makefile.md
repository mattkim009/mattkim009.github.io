title: The benefits of the Make Utility

	The make utility is used to perform an action on multiple files with a one-word command (e.g. "make") or two-word command (e.g. "make example.o").  For example, instead of writing the compiling command and then listing every single file to be compiled one can simply write "make example.o" to create the object file, relieving a lot of time and tedious effort.  The one-word command "make", is a one-word command that the make utility uses and, when evoked, will perform the first command listed in the Makefile.  If there are other commands that need to be executed before the first command then, so long as the commands are entered in the Makefile, the make utility will execute those commands in ascending order.
