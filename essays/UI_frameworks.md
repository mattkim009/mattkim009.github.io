A UI framework (User Interface framework) is a software framework based in HTML that provides CSS packages and/or Javascript functions to facilitate the development of the layout of the pages (e.g. typography).  The provided packages and functions greatly simplify the process of creating web pages by lightening the work load for one doesnâ€™t have to code every detail of the web page.  For example, 
 
<div class="ui centered rounded images">
  <img class="ui image" src="https://ics314f13.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/browserhistory3.png">
  <img class="ui image" src="http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314s19/morea/ui-frameworks/experience-browser-history-semantic.png">
</div>

## Learning curve   
   It takes around 100 lines to code a dropdown menu on raw HTML and CSS compared to semantic UI where we can simply use the provided 'dropdown' module greatly reducing the code we have to type.
