  A UI framework (User Interface framework) is a software framework based in HTML that provides CSS packages and/or Javascript functions to facilitate the development of the layout of the pages (e.g. typography).  The provided packages and functions greatly simplify the process of creating web pages by lightening the work load for one doesnâ€™t have to code every detail of the web page.  For example, when I coded the web page on the left below in raw HTML and CSS the CSS file ended up being 20-30 lines long.  This is much longer than the approximately 5 lines I coded in the CSS file to create the web page on the bottom right where I used Semantic UI.

## The learning curve   
  Of course to take advantage of a UI framework one needs to spend the time and effort to learn the components (similar to HTML elements) and utility styles it provides.  For example, Semantic UI provides over 50 different components which are sorted into four different categories (Elements, Collections, Views, Modules) based on complexity, functionality, and purpose.  At first it seems daunting to learn what every component does and how to utilize them.  I spent over 3 hours watching video tutorials that gave an overview of nearly every single component and am in no means an expert.  However, I was able to code web pages that would take me two times the amount of time to code in raw HTML and CSS.  Things like navigation bars or tabs require CSS code that's already provided by the Semantic UI library so I wouldn't need to code anything in CSS.  The benefit is even greater when dealing with more complex features like a dropdown menu which takes around 100 lines to code on raw HTML and CSS copmared to when using Semantic UI where one can simply use the provided 'dropdown' Module component greatly reducing the code we have to type.  

## It's worth a try
  Basically, UI frameworks cuts down a lot time by providing pre-coded features that are commonly used in web pages.  Instead of having to code these features from the ground up every single time we make a new web page one can save time and just use the pre-coded features provided.  If one wishes to be a front-end developer it's worth looking at UI frameworks to save time and effort.
