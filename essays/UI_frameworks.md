A UI framework (User Interface framework) is a software framework based in HTML that provides CSS packages and/or Javascript functions to facilitate the development of the layout of the pages (e.g. typography).  The provided packages and functions greatly simplify the process of creating web pages by lightening the work load for one doesnâ€™t have to code every detail of the web page.  For example, when I coded the web page on the left below in raw HTML and CSS the CSS file ended up being 20-30 lines long.  This is much longer than the approximately 5 lines I coded in the CSS file to create the web page on the bottom right where I used Semantic UI.

   Well, I can profess that after only 3 hours of video tutorials I was able to code a 
   It takes around 100 lines to code a dropdown menu on raw HTML and CSS compared to semantic UI where we can simply use the provided 'dropdown' module greatly reducing the code we have to type.
